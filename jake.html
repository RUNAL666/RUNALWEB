            <p class="wiki">Jake Sunshinko - a magical boy who is the nobility of the sunbeam. Basically, he does not go to any work like her older sister <a href="runal.html" class="runalurl">Runal</a>, he goes to his own plans to get any awards.
                He walks anywhere: not far or far, or even the farthest path. He never loses his home because he has the ability to return to his home with his magic. He is an unknown person in the world, as people never even noticed him, and did not know about his existence on earth.
                Jake was most of all a funny person, he loves to make good jokes.</p>
