            <p class="desc">―This is a game about a beautiful adult girl called Jancie Mackenzie. In which, from beginning to end, she becomes a demon and a real killer of this world.</p>
            <h4>History</h4>
            <p class="hist">Jancie was bored sitting at home with nothing to do while her boyfriend(McHecz) was busy with his work.
                Then Jancie thought about her walk to some places, without her boyfriend. And now Jancie is going on her own adventure!</p>
            <p class="histtwo">One day Jancie decided to take her own risk and walk through the beautiful nature of the Forest. And then something unknown happened in this place...</p>
            <h4>Other words from the Author</h4>
            <p class="one">This game is also an alternative version of the game from the original developer <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/McHecz-EXE/525337" class="red" target="_blank">McHecz.EXE</a> by @MH-Games™ (Author's opinion)</p>
            <p class="two">And I created this game out of my own interest, since from the old original game I decided to make it much better!</p>
