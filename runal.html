            <p class="wiki1">Runal Starfinko - The girl is a witch, the predecessor of demons. Basically, she likes to walk around in an empty place, especially during midnight, likes to carry firearms for fun, or go out hunting over someone, likes to cut people's flesh.
                By her appearance: she’s like a gangster on earth, that people pay attention to her, and apparently they’re not looking for her, even if she didn’t kill anyone.</p>
            <p class="wiki2">She manifests it with her pentagram called - Star Power. [Pic.2]
                The Star Power makes Runal the most powerful witch in which not even one person can defeat her, since after acquiring the Star Power she feels much stronger. After this, she can call her attack.</p>
            <p class="wiki3">Runal is also the older sister of her younger brother <a href="jake.html" class="jakeurl">Jake</a>. She plays with him sometimes, together they are like best friends for eternity, with a rare meeting with her brother, she reveals her true joy with a greeting on the hand, or when they meet, they begin to hug each other.</p>
            <h4>In the world</h4>
            <p class="wiki4">In the transition to friendship, she also has friends (just ordinary people). With friends, she pretends to be a friendly person, so as not to show herself as a threat to her friends, she spent more time with them: with their walk, with their travels, and with them at the party.</p>
            <p class="wiki5">According to her reflection, Runal treats humanity as pathetic insects without consciousness, she believes this because she shows with their creation, with their activities from their point of view about people as a true person with whom she knows what could happen to them. And with this, Runal underestimates this world.</p>
            <h4>Facts</h4>
            <p>I. Runal likes to attack with firearms more than with magic (Because she believes that their bullets kill a person much faster than with her ability.)</p>
            <p>II. Runal is also a hardworking person and loves to create her work in her labs.</p>
            <p>III. Runal doesn't like being married to someone, she only cares about her friends and even her younger brother.</p>
            <p>IV. Runal does not have female breasts, since she was born without them, but she almost looks like a boy.</p>
